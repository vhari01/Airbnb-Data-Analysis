# Airbnb-Data-Analysis
This project explores how room type, number of reviews, and availability affect Airbnb prices in NYC. Using data from the NYC Airbnb Open Data set, we apply exploratory analysis, data cleaning, and regression modeling to uncover pricing trends. The goal is to provide useful insights for Airbnb hosts and budget-minded travelers through visualization
